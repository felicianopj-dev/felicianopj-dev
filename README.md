### Backend Developer (PHP/Laravel) — APIs, Payments & Fintech Integrations

I'm a backend developer with 10+ years of experience building secure and reliable APIs in PHP/Laravel, with a strong focus on fintech systems, payment workflows, fraud prevention and credit-risk integrations.

My work involves designing clean architectures, integrating external services, and building high-sensitivity systems that require strong validation, encryption, logging and predictable behavior.
